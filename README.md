# Simple Sauce Lab Examples
* Very simple tests for Sauce Labs. I used Python3, so you should make sure to use the same. 

* You'll also need to set your username and access key as environment variables; more info here: https://docs.saucelabs.com/basics/environment-variables/#setting-up-environment-variables

# Installing requirements
* You may not need all the packages in the requirements file, but you can install them to your python like so (update the path as needed):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Running Tests
* After installing the requirements, you can run Desktop tests from your terminal with the following command:

```
python3 NFP_Desktop.py
```
* or for Real iOS Device Tests:

```
python3 NFP_RDC.py
```


# Happy Testing!
